## **Prediction of Leaf Diseases in Roses with ResNet50**

## üìã **Objective**
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting leaf diseases in rose plants. Early detection of leaf diseases is essential for maintaining the health and quality of rose cultivation, reducing pesticide use, and ensuring optimal yields. By using advanced image classification techniques, the project aims to provide reliable disease identification to assist growers in making timely decisions.
